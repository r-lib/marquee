marquee is a markdown parser and renderer for the R graphics engine. It
can be used to render rich text formatted as markdown (CommonMark)
inside R graphics such as ggplot2 or other graphics build on grid

## Installation

marquee is not yet on CRAN. In the meantime you can install the
development version like so:

``` r
pak::pak("thomasp85/marquee")
```

## Examples

The main function of the package is `marquee_grob()` which creates a
grob based on markdown text and a style that can be rendered with grid:

``` r
# Let's render this readme
readme <- paste(readLines("README.Rmd")[-seq_len(17)], collapse = "\n")

library(marquee)
library(grid)

fancy_style <- classic_style(
  body_font = "baskerville", 
  header_font = "marker felt",
  code_font = "fira code"
) |> 
  modify_style("cb", background = linearGradient(
    colours = c("lightblue", "white"),
    x1 = 0, y1 = 1, x2 = 0, y2 = 0
  ))
grob <- marquee_grob(readme, style = fancy_style)
grid.draw(grob)
```

## Prior art

I would be remiss to not mention
[gridtext](https://github.com/wilkelab/gridtext) and
[ggtext](https://github.com/wilkelab/ggtext), both by Claus Wilke. These
packages aims to solve much the same as marquee, but work in a different
way and doesnâ€™t have the same powerful textshaping backend as marquee.
Most notably from a user perspective is perhaps that gridtext
understands HTML to some degree, whereas marquee is oblivious to both
HTML and CSS. Instead it supports the full CommonMark spec with the plan
to add support for custom span elements as well.
