# marquee (development version)

* HTML entities now return the correct symbols (@clauswilke, #89)

# marquee 1.2.1

* Fixed a bug when calculating em() of a relative sized style
* Fixed a bug in outline glyphs
* Fixed a bug in `force_body_margin`
* Make sure that `width` is properly propagated in Â´guide_marquee()`

# marquee 1.2.0

* Better vectorisation of style_set and classic_style
* Renamed `border_size` to `border_width` for consistency
* Added `border_type` and `outline_type` styles to control the linetype of
  borders and outlines
* Underline and strikethrough now uses metrics from the font for width and
  position

# marquee 1.1.1

* Fixed a bug in `element_marquee()` that resulted in wrong width calculation
  for rotated text (#69)
* If image URLs doesn't indicate image format marquee will attempt to sniff it
* Fixes an S7 compatibility issue with merge_element (#83)
* marquee should no longer open a graphics device if none exists (#75)
* `element_marquee()` now works with factor input and will fall back to
  `element_text()` for expressions (#71)

# marquee 1.1.0

* Size of `element_marquee()` is communicated similar to `element_text()` (#57)
* You can now change the size by using a {.size ...} shortcut, e.g. {.30 BIG} to
  render `BIG` with font size 30
* Added functionality to add outline to text as well as adding the `.out` style.
  Outlines can be controlled with the `outline`, `outline_width`, `outline_join`
  and `outline_mitre` style settings (#60)
* Added support for PNG and JPEG files from URLs (#63)
* Fixed a bug in bullet placement when the bullet was the last in the document
  and contained multiple text spans (#54)
* Fixed a bug in nested unordered bullet lists where the calculated bullet would
  be wrong (#53)
* Fixed a bug when using ordered list
* Fixed various bugs in `guide_marquee()`

# marquee 1.0.0

* Fixed a bug in bullet placement that affected tight lists with multiple spans
  (#18)
* code spans gains a slight horizontal padding to let the background breathe a
  bit. Currently padding around spans doesn't affect shaping (i.e. it doesn't
  move text further from it's neighbors).
* Better adherence to margin collapsing rules of CSS. Any background or border
  will now prevent further collapsing
* Add `force_body_margin` argument to enforce that the body margin is not
  influenced by collapsing (allowing you to turn it off completely). This
  setting is turned on for `geom_marquee()` and `element_marquee()` (#23)
* Add support for rendering on graphics devices that doesn't support the new
  `glyphs` capabilities
* Inline padding now reserves space on the left and right side during shaping if
  the inline tag has decoration (background or border)
* Added `guide_marquee()` to make allow legends with keys mixed into free text
  descriptions

# marquee 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
