# marquee (development version)

* Fixed a bug in bullet placement that affected tight lists with multiple spans 
  (#18)
* code spans gains a slight horizontal padding to let the background breathe a 
  bit. Currently padding around spans doesn't affect shaping (i.e. it doesn't 
  move text further from it's neighbors)

# marquee 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
